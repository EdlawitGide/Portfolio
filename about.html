        <h1 class="about-title">Get to Know Me </h1><br>
        <p>
        I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Information Technology with
        a Minor in Financial Planning, with an expected graduation in December
        2026. My passion for technology and problem-solving developed later in
        my academic journey, but since discovering it, I’ve been fully immersed.
       I love how technology can be used to solve real-world problems, and I find the process of creating solutions both meaningful and rewarding. <p><br>
        Throughout my studies, I have gained practical
        experience in both front-end and back-end development through a variety
        of hands-on projects. These opportunities have allowed me to apply my
        knowledge in real-world contexts and sharpen my problem-solving skills.
        I thrive on the challenge of building systems that are both functional
        and visually appealing, and I find it fulfilling to see my ideas come to
        life. 
        </p>
        <p> <br> In addition to my coursework, I have worked on several full-stack
        web applications, designed data visualizations, and applied predictive
        models. I am passionate about working on impactful projects and am particularly interested in Software Engineering, Product Management, Machine Learning, and FinTech. I am always eager to expand my knowledge
        and am actively seeking internship opportunities where I can learn,
        grow, and make valuable contributions.
        </p>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Outside of my academic work, I enjoy spending quality time with friends
        and family, who are an important source of support and motivation. I am
        also an avid listener of R&B music, which helps me unwind, and I love
        traveling to explore new places and immerse myself in different
        cultures.
      </p>
